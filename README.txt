# Finding Hash Fixpoints in SHA-1 and Merkle Trees Thereof

This project uses CUDA to optimize the search for hash fixpoints -- sequences
of bytes whose SHA-1 hash begins with those bytes -- and the related problem
of making a git commit that writes its own hash to a file.

For running the CUDA versions: TODO

For running the CPU versions, see cpu_demo/README.txt
